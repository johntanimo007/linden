**Patent Pending • Deterministic AI Safety Rating & Insurance**

Linden AI Assurance is a pioneering concept for standardized safety auditing and liability insurance for AI agents and logic engines. In an era where AI hallucinations and logic breaks could lead to massive financial/legal risks, Linden provides a middleware API that runs rigorous, binary deterministic stress tests (10,000+ adversarial scenarios) to achieve **99.9% accuracy** — far surpassing the industry’s typical 95%.

### Core Value Proposition
- **Problem**: No malpractice-style insurance exists for AI agents—companies hesitate to deploy high-stakes automation (legal, medical, finance) due to liability fears.
- **Solution**: Plug-and-play assurance layer with proprietary deterministic auditing (not probabilistic), issuing smart-contract-backed policies.
- **Moat**: Collects global failure data → becomes the "Moody’s/S&P" of AI risk.
- **Revenue Model**: 1–3% fee on AI-managed transaction value (scalable to billions).

### Key Features (High-Level)
- Three proprietary stress tests: Logic-Bomb Probe, Hallucination Pressure Gradient, Prompt Injection Persistence.
- Binary pass/fail deterministic outcomes.
- Automated claims auditor with forensic re-simulation and HITL for high-value claims.
- "Hallucination Clause" indemnification up to policy limits.
